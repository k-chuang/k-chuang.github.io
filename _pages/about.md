Hello world! I'm Kevin Chuang. I'm a software engineer and also a data engineer (I should just pick one and stick with it).

I have a BS in electrical engineering from University of California, San Diego and a MS in software engineering with a specialization in data science at San Jose State University.

I decided to switch from EE to software engineering, because I realized I really enjoyed programming. I am mostly self-taught in Python and started learning by writing little Python scripts to automate things like moving files around or downloading lots of audio files online. To further my knowledge and passion, I decided to pursue a Master's in software engineering. That's where I realized the power of software & data, and how much I enjoyed working with both. This led me to engage in a career as a Data Engineer, where I can happily work with both.

Rather then list out all of my hobbies, I want to show what I do on my free time. Whenever I have time, I enjoy spending time on personal software projects & showcasing them on Github. In addition, I really enjoy gaming, skateboarding, and traveling, and I also enjoy creating & editing Youtube videos around these 3 hobbies using Final Cut Pro. I love photography, and always try to take pictures especially when I travel (usually with just my iPhone, but thinking about getting a film camera). You can check these photos out on my VSCO profile (link below). More recently, I started playing a lot of online chess on Chess.com, slowly trying to reach 1200 rating in Rapid games (and trying not to get tilted when I lose 5 games in a row or blunder the queen).

Below are my social links that showcase some of my hobbies. Feel free to follow me on any of the platforms!
