Hello world! I am currently a Machine Learning Engineer at CBS Interactive in the Applied Machine Learning Group, where I work on developing and productionizing ML services. I enjoy using data in clever ways to discover interesting insights and help make informed decisions. My interests include programming & automating things. The fields that interest me the most are data science, machine learning, and deep learning (Computer Vision, Natural Language Processing). To further this passion, I have actively pursued opportunities to learn and apply these concepts by working on personal projects, taking online and graduate courses, listening to AI-related podcasts, participating in AI challenges, and doing whatever I can to further my understanding of these fields. My hobbies include video editing, skateboarding, hanging out with friends, playing basketball and working out.
