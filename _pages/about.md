Hello world! I currently work as a Data Engineer at HomeLight. I have a MS in software engineering with a specialization in data science at San Jose State University and a BS in electrical engineering with a focus on machine learning from University of California, San Diego.

My interests include programming, building stuff, automating things, and working with data. The fields that interest me the most are software engineering, system design, data engineering, and data science / machine learning.

My hobbies include programming, skateboarding, writing, video editing, photography, hanging out with friends, playing basketball and working out.
