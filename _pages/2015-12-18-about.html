<p>Hello world! Iâ€™m Kevin! I am a junior data scientist who is passionate about using data to discover interesting insights and help make informed decisions.</p>
<p>To view my portfolio, check out my <a href="https://kevinchuangblog.wordpress.com/resume-cv/">Resume / CV</a>.</p>
<p>My interests include programming &amp; automating things. The fields that interest me the most are data science, machine learning, and deep learning (Computer Vision, Natural Language Processing). To further this passion, I have actively pursued opportunities to learn and apply these concepts by working on personal projects, taking online and graduate courses, listening to AI-related podcasts, and participating in AI challenges. My favorite podcasts include: Talk Python To Me, Linear Digressions, DataFramed, Software Engineering Daily, Data Skeptic, Freakonomics, The Super Data Science Podcast, and Talking Machines.</p>
<p>My hobbies include skateboarding, writing, photography, hanging out with friends, playing basketball and working out.</p>
