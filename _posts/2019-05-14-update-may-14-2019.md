I haven't posted in a while due to being busy with work and school. Here are some updates!

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->

- I have added a new page on this blog for my resume. It is located here: [Resume / CV](https://kevinchuangblog.wordpress.com/resume-cv/).
- I have left my current job and have a Data Science internship for the summer of 2019! I will be working as a data science intern at CBS Interactive in the Applied Machine Learning Group! I am super excited and extremely grateful for this opportunity. So thank you to CBS Interactive and the Applied Machine Learning Group :)
- I have been working on a deep learning/ computer vision project for vehicle re-identification for [NVIDIA's AI City Challenge 2019](https://www.aicitychallenge.org/). I may include a blog post about this project in the near future.
